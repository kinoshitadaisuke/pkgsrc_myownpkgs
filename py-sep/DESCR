Source Extractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) is a widely used command-line
program for segmentation and analysis of astronomical images. It reads
in FITS format files, performs a configurable series of tasks, including
background estimation, source detection, deblending and a wide array of
source measurements, and finally outputs a FITS format catalog file.

While Source Extractor is highly useful, the fact that it can only be
used as an executable can limit its applicability or lead to awkward
workflows. There is often a desire to have programmatic access to perform
one or more of the above tasks on in-memory images as part of a larger
custom analysis.

SEP makes the core algorithms of Source Extractor available as a library
of stand-alone functions and classes. These operate directly on in-memory
arrays (no FITS files or configuration files). The code is derived from
the Source Extractor code base (written in C) and aims to produce results
compatible with Source Extractor whenever possible. SEP consists of a
C library with no dependencies outside the standard library, and a Python
module that wraps the C library in a Pythonic API. The Python wrapper
operates on NumPy arrays with NumPy as its only dependency. See below
for language-specfic build and usage instructions.
