Celerity is a lightweight, research-grade, zero-dependency type-safe Python 
library for astronomical calculations to plan your observations. It's only 
dependency is the Python 3.11+ standard library.

It has been designed to be independent of any other popular astronomical 
libraries, with a focus on providing a simple and intuitive API for 
performing common astronomical calculations.

This project is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet 
ready for production use.
