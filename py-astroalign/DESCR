**ASTROALIGN** is a python module that will try to align two stellar
astronomical images, especially when there is no WCS information available.

It does so by finding similar 3-point asterisms (triangles) in both images
and deducing the affine transformation between them.

Generic registration routines try to match feature points, using corner
detection routines to make the point correspondence.
