REBOUND is an N-body integrator, i.e. a software package that can
integrate the motion of particles under the influence of gravity.
The particles can represent stars, planets, moons, ring or dust
particles. REBOUND is very flexible and can be customized to accurately
and efficiently solve many problems in astrophysics.
