**MyST is a rich and extensible flavor of Markdown meant for technical documentation and publishing**.

MyST is a flavor of markdown that is designed for simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility.
This repository serves as the reference implementation of MyST Markdown, as well as a collection of tools to support working with MyST in Python and Sphinx.
It contains an extended [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)-compliant parser using [`markdown-it-py`](https://markdown-it-py.readthedocs.io/), as well as a [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) extension that allows you to write MyST Markdown in Sphinx.

[**See the MyST Parser documentation for more information**](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
