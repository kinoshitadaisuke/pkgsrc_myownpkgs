Python MIP is a collection of Python tools for the modeling and solution
of Mixed-Integer Linear programs (MIPs). MIP syntax was inspired by
[Pulp](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp). Just like
[CyLP](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP) it also provides access to
advanced solver features like cut generation, lazy constraints, MIPstarts
and solution Pools. Porting Pulp and Gurobi models should be quite easy.
