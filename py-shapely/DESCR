Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of 
planar geometric objects. It is using the widely deployed open-source 
geometry library GEOS (the engine of PostGIS, and a port of JTS). Shapely 
wraps GEOS geometries and operations to provide both a feature rich 
Geometry interface for singular (scalar) geometries and higher-performance 
NumPy ufuncs for operations using arrays of geometries. Shapely is not 
primarily focused on data serialization formats or coordinate systems, 
but can be readily integrated with packages that are.
