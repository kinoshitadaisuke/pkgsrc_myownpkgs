TRIPPy is a python package aimed to perform all the steps required to measure
accurate photometry of both trailed and non-trailed (stationary) astronomical
sources. This includes the ability to generate stellar and trailed point
source functions, and to use circular and pill shaped apertures to measure
photometry and estimate appropriate aperture corrections.
