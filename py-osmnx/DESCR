OSMnx is a Python package to easily download, model, analyze, and visualize
street networks and other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap. You can
download and model walking, driving, or biking networks with a single line
of code then analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily work with
urban amenities/points of interest, building footprints, transit stops,
elevation data, street orientations, speed/travel time, and routing.
