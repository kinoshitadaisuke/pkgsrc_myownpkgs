# OpenAI Python API library

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/openai.svg?label=pypi%20(stable))](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)

The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from any Python 3.8+
application. The library includes type definitions for all request params and response fields,
and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients powered by [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx).

It is generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) with [Stainless](https://stainlessapi.com/).

## Documentation

The REST API documentation can be found on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference). The full API of this library can be found in [api.md](api.md).

## Installation

```sh
# install from PyPI
pip install openai
...
