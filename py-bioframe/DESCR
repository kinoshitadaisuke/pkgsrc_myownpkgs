Bioframe is a library to enable flexible and scalable operations on genomic
interval dataframes in python. Building bioframe directly on top of pandas
enables immediate access to a rich set of dataframe operations. Working in
python enables rapid visualization (e.g. matplotlib, seaborn) and iteration
of genomic analyses.

The philosophy underlying bioframe is to enable flexible operations:
instead of creating a function for every possible use-case, we instead
encourage users to compose functions to achieve their goals.

Bioframe implements a variety of genomic interval operations directly on
dataframes. Bioframe also includes functions for loading diverse genomic
data formats, and performing operations on special classes of genomic
intervals, including chromosome arms and fixed size bins.
