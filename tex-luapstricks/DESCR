This package enables the use of PSTricks directly in LuaLaTeX documents,
without invoking external programmes, by implementing a PostScript
interpreter in Lua. Therefore it does not require shell escape to be
enabled or special environments, and instead allows PSTricks to be used
exactly like in dvips based documents.
